                <p className="about-desc">I'm a senior Computer Science student at Georgia State University with a background in pharmacy. I previously worked at a 120-bed hospital and now work at Grady Hospital, a Level I trauma center with over 1,000 beds. After nearly a decade in healthcare, I transitioned into tech to pursue software engineering and DevOps. Iâ€™m currently building full-stack projects and expanding my skills in cloud technologies and infrastructure automation.</p>
